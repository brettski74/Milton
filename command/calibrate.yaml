# calibrate:
# The set of calibration temperatures to be captured during the calibration.
# If specified as numbers, you should use celsius.
# You can also use many solder alloy abbreviations like Sn63Pb37 for the
# the standard eutectic tin-lead solder alloy. This is handy if you are using
# solder alloys for your calibration temperature "sensors" and will use the
# melting point of those alloys as the calibration temperature.
# The list will be sorted internally, so the order does not matter here.
# 
temperatures:
  - 100
  - 140
  - 180
  - 200

# The initial current to send to the hotplate when calibration starts. This
# is to allow measurement of the resistance of the heating element when the
# calibration cycle starts. We need an initial estimate of the resistance to
# be able to apply a known power level to the hotplate.
initial-current: 2

# The rate of temperature increase to use during the slow-ramp portion of the
# hotplate calibration. This is only approximate, since we won't have
# accurate mapping from resistance to temperature, yet. It needs to be
# reasonably slow to avoid inaccuracies due to thermal inertia and offset
# effects. Keeping the rate of temperature rise to be reasonably slow should
# help minimize some of these effects.
ramp-rate: 0.3

# The smoothing factor to be applied to hotplate readings when looking for a
# steady state condition. This must be a value be greater than 0 and less
# than 1. Values closer to 1 mean more smoothing, slower response, lower
# sensitivity to noise and a longer time for the calibration cycle to settle.
# Values closer to 0 mean the opposite of all of that. Given that this is a
# calibration of a heating device, lower noise sensitivity is a good thing.
# Spend 20-30 minutes calibrating your hotplates. You'll be happy you did!
steady-state-smoothing: 0.9

# The number of samples required to consider the hotplate at a steady state
# condition. More samples generally means longer time for the calibration
# cycle to settle and a higher probability of getting closer to the true
# steady state during the calibration.
steady-state-samples: 10

# The maximum difference between successive resistance readings to start
# counting samples toward the steady state condition.
steady-state-threshold: 0.0001

# The minimum difference between successive resistance readings to stop
# counting samples toward the steady state condition and reset the steady
# state sample count to zero.
steady-state-reset: 0.00015

# The number of seconds to hold at a constant temperature after the completion
# of the slow-ramp stage of calibration and before starting the constant power
# cool down. This is to help ensure that the cool down curve that is measured
# starts from a reasonably steady state of the hotplate and avoid any
# inaccuracies due to thermal inertia and offset effects.
hold-time: 15

# The power in watts to be applied to the hotplate during the warm up and cool
# down stages of the calibration. Ideally, this should be set to a reasonable
# power level that should get the hotplate somewhere close to the mid point of
# its operating range - perhaps somewhere around 90-100 celsius. The default
# value of 29W should do fine for hotplates that are roughly 100mm x 100mm.
calibration-power: 29
