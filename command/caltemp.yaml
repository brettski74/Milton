# The set of temperatures for which to calibrate the holding power and resistance.
# Note that since this command assumes that we have no calibration as of yet, it
# will likely calculate values on slightly different temperatures than those
# specified, but it will attempt to obtain values as close as reasonably possible
# to these temperatures.
# Calibrating temperatures below 75 celsius may be very slow and is not recommended.
temperatures:
  - 75
  - 100
  - 140
  - 180
  - 200

# The number of on-off cycles to complete during the bang-bang stages of the
# calibration. The first few captures will be skipped to allow the hotplate to
# stabilize. After that the specified number of high-low cycles will be completed
# and captured for calibration calculations.
cycles:
  capture: 20
  skip: 8
