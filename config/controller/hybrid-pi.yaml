# Low-pass filter time constant on the feed-forward signal.
# The default is 0 - ie. no low-pass filtering. This will probably produce the lowest mean-squared error
# but it also may produce a wildly oscillating control signal. Setting this to a small, positive value
# will reduce the oscillations in the control signal but at the expense of slightly higher mean-squared
# error and larger overshoot/undershoot where there are discontinuities in the reflow profile gradient.
feed-forward-tau: 1.5

# Low-pass filter time constant on the control signal. This is similar to the feed-forward-tau parameter
# but applies to the entire control signal (ie. feed-forward + PI). The PI controller is less likely to
# need filtering, so you probably want to leave this at zero.
control-tau: 0

# Gain on the feed-forward signal.
# By default we use the full feed-forward signal (ie. a gain of 1);
# Values above 1 are probably a bad idea.
# Values under 1 will reduce the feed-forward signal and require the PI controller to play a larger role
# in temperature control. 
# A value of 0 disables feed-forward control entirely and turns this controller into a pure PI controller.
feed-forward-gain: 0

# The percentage of maximum power at which to clamp the output of the integral term of the PI controller.
# Integral windup protection is implemented in two ways. First is the anti-windup gain (kaw) which will
# unwind the integral as the control signal exceeds the maximum power. The second is a hard clamp which
# prevents the integral term from contributing more to the control signal than a certain fixed amount,
# specified here as a percentage of the maximum power. If this is set to 30 and maximum power is 150W,
# then the integral term can contribute at more +/-45W to the control signal.
