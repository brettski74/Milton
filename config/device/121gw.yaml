# Maximum offset from the previous reading that is considered realistic. Used to avoid
# potential errors in communication. It's unlikely that the temperature will change by
# a very large margin between two readings. Readings typically come about 2-3 times per
# second. The typical value for this is 10 since a jump or drop in temperature of 10
# degrees celsius in less than a second is highly unliklely.
max-offset: 10

# Minimum and maximum values for the temperature reading. Again, these are used to avoid
# erroneous readings.
# It's unlikely that the temperature will go below ambient room temperature, so setting
# this to a value lower than the room is every likely to be tells the software that
# there's an error. The typical minimum value is 5 degrees celsius. This is probably
# adequate unless you live in a fridge or work outside at some Antarctic station or
# something.
min-value: 5

# The maximum value should be set to a value that is reasonably higher than the hotplate
# is ever likely to be under normal use. The typical value is 250 celsius, which should be
# higher than you'll even be operating your hotplate - at least for hotplates that include
# a DIY thermal fuse made from readily available solder alloys.
max-value: 250
